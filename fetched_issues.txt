Please describe.**
I'm frustrated when I've joined my iOS device to a ZeroTier network, connected it, and then find that it has disconnected after some time of inactivity or link drop.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like to be able to configure ZeroTier networks as _Always On_, or _Connect on Demand_ on my iOS device so that every request is made through my chosen ZeroTier network.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Building my own app is an option, but seems like an unnecessary duplication of effort.

**Describe the bug**
When i try to connect to a Network, it's not working mostly. At the Bottom i can see \"ONLINE\", but it's not connected to the VPN. I must try 9-10 times before it's working.

**To Reproduce**
1. Connect to a network with the phone
2. In 60% of the cases, you are not connected and you cannot see the VPN Key in the Notification Bar

**Expected behavior**
I will connect to the network without these bug.

So, for example, the current values on my system are 56 bits wide, which means that the low order 3 bits are lost.

Really the only \"safe\" way to deal with this is to provide an alternate form of representation. One option is to represent these as a string. Another option is to break the value up (often into high and low 32-bit dword values.)

I have installed ZertoTier One on WIndows 7 and used the GUI to join a network which was then displayed in the GUI as expected. When the computer is rebooted however, the GUI has no details of the network and the Node ID is shown as unknown. Seecting \"Show Networks...\" display a window with a plain white background and nothing else.

The service is running and executing the command zerotier-cli shownetworks from the command prompt shows the connected network details as expected and ipconfig shows the interface with the expected IP address

Removing and re-installing ZeroTier One fixes the issue temporarily until the computer is rebooted again.

My WIndows 7 machine is a VMWare virtual machine but I do not see as this should make a difference. I don't have a physical Windows 7 machine.

**To Reproduce**
1. Install ZeroTier One
2. Join a network
3. Confirm GUI shows network information correctly and that machine is reachable o ZeroTier IP.
4. Reboot computer
5. Note that GUI no longer has details of the network (THIS IS THE ERROR)
6. Confirm that machine is still reachabe over ZeroTier IP
7. Confirm that command line client correclty displays details.
[zerotier_issue_win7.pdf](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/files/2378258/zerotier_issue_win7.pdf)

**Expected behavior**
In step 5 above it is expected that the GUI displays details of the connected network and allows management of that connection.

**Screenshots**

Windows 10 Pro 1809 (Insider build 17758.1) will not reconnect to ZeroTier network after machine is rebooted. The ZeroTier service does not start despite being marked as enabled. This issue isn't limited to ZeroTier. The same behavior is observed with another third party service. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Be running Windows 10 1809 (I've observed this on earlier 1809 Insider builds as well)
2. Install ZeroTier One client and join network and authorize device. Set ZeroTier One client to start with Windows.
3. ZeroTier One client will be fully functional - can access resources via ZeroTier network, ZeroTier Windows service will be running.
4. Reboot computer
5. Log back into Windows.
6. Observe ZeroTier One client will show node ID as unknown. ZeroTier service will not be running, still shows as automatic. 
7. Exit ZeroTier One client. Start ZeroTier service, start ZeroTier One client, device re-joins ZeroTier network.

**Expected behavior**
After reboot, ZeroTier One client should be running (with option to start with Windows enabled) along with the ZeroTier service.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows
 - OS/Distribution Version: 10 Professional 1809 (Build 17758.1)
 - ZeroTier Version 1.2.12
 - Hardware Lenovo ThinkCentre

**Additional context**
I'm running ZeroTier on a home network. I have other Windows 10 Professional devices joined to the same network, running the same client version. When these devices reboot, the ZeroTier One client works as expected. 

Similar behavior has been observed on Windows Server 2016, although it's more random. Sometimes the service starts as expected, other times after a reboot the service will not start automatically.

I have not seen any errors in the Event Viewer related to this issue.

I figured I would file a bug report about this now since Windows 10 1809 is expected out in about a months time or sooner.

I had to patch `osdep/OSUtils.cpp` to let habitat change it at build time, and it would be helpful to be able to change it at runtime too. I explored first creating wrapper scripts for all zerotier's commands that would pass the environmental home directory as a CLI argument, but that was messy and inhibited users from from using that CLI argument for their own purposes

A thing isn't clear and reliable for me is about how ZeroTier handles horizontal and vertical handover. In a symptomatic perspective, changing from a 802.11 to LTE can in worst case take more than 3 minutes to reach the network. Unlikelly I used to think, the worst case is when I change from NATed network to double NATed network (I think IPv6 to IPv4 may be worst, but no). Since my mobile carrier - as example - only uses CGNAT prefixes, if I need for some reason to exit a NAT to a CGNAT+Android Tether network it tooks a life to come back. I've already experimented this kind of issue on other network handover type.

Speculatively speaking, after read https://zerotier.com/manual.shtml#2_1_1 I conclude ZT does not implement something like HMAC to allow a changed-address peer to reuse a existent connection (Receiving a packet from other address and accepting it since its authenticated) and allow other peer to restablish the return path again (Using hole punch or other techniques).

This differ from a bug report because handover isnt a issue and its a predictable behaviour. Handover costs time and vertical handovers specially loss a lot of packets. But I think the network convergence of ZT takes too long, longer than Skype - as example - that also use techiniques to mitigate handover effects.

So, what ZT can explain or even change about the way it does handover?

I must disabled Tinc device in /var/lib/zerotier/local.conf, because Zerotier initially routed traffic through Tinc. After that 'zerotier-cli listpeers' shows correct external addresses and port 9993, but I suppose traffic goes through some zerotier planet server. 

Zerotier should be clever and fallback to TCP when available on port 9993.

The ping packet loss is 29%, and with these stats: `rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 5.085/2301.156/9978.148/2866.061 ms`.

The Client and Gateway hosts are both Ubuntu 16. I've spun these up in two independent data centers that don't add any additional firewall restrictions (such as a security group), and the Linux firewall rules on both hosts are permissive (default ACCEPT). I've also experienced the same performance characteristics when the client is macOS, although that wasn't in a data center. Note that I'm using IPv4.

Both Client and Gateway belong to the same ZeroTier network. The Gateway host is also configured as an internet gateway (following the knowledge base instructions). On the Client, if I run two \"speedof.me\" internet tests while at the same time I ping the ZeroTier IP for the Gateway, I experience these dropped packets and delays.

The baseline ping round trip time (over ZeroTier, without the transfer taking place between the Client and Gateway) is <7ms and there is no packet loss. The ping connects the two hosts directly (that is, ZeroTier is able to send its encrypted packets directly between these two hosts over UDP at all time).

I'd like to confirm external reproducibility of this issue, and I'd also like to understand in the optimistic case, what is possible here? Is ZeroTier positioned to respond well to this situation in general? Are the performance characteristics coming up because of something specific?

I notice very little resource overhead (negligible CPU) on both hosts, so I'm wondering what might be going on. These concerns also include the case where more than one client (this time, behind a NAT - but with the same external egress IP) is connecting to the Gateway, but I've run the test just involving one connecting client.", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/815/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0 } }, { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/812", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/812/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/812/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/812/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/812", "id": 342117970, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzNDIxMTc5NzA=", "number": 812, "title": "How to Install ZeroTierOne on a mipsle32 system", "user": { "login": "Julian-Mentasti", "id": 21285954, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1OTU0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/21285954?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Julian-Mentasti", "html_url": "https://github.com/Julian-Mentasti", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Julian-Mentasti/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Julian-Mentasti/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Julian-Mentasti/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Julian-Mentasti/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Julian-Mentasti/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Julian-Mentasti/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Julian-Mentasti/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Julian-Mentasti/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Julian-Mentasti/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false }, "labels": [ { "id": 81781561, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw4MTc4MTU2MQ==", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/labels/compatibility", "name": "compatibility", "color": "c7def8", "default": false } ], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [ ], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2018-07-17T22:56:29Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-20T22:55:42Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Hey ,

Can you explain (e.g. based on programming methodology) why you think it's secure? E.g. I have the impression that you don't use a lot of networking or crypto libraries and instead provide implementations which you have partially copy-pasted (from reputable sources at the time, I will admit that), which results in longer term maintenance and security problems. All in all, it seems to be optimized for speed (presumably to look good in benchmarks), not security (other than in terms of buzzwords).

You could potentially apply here: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz.

I think it has been out of beta for quite some time and other than the heavily commented https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/blob/master/node/Packet.hpp I was not able to find anything. I am quite happy to just operate with `Packet.hpp`, but this is certainly not the case for other people in our organisation.

There are negative implications of this - when somebody connected over zerotiers enters network that is same as one routed through managed routes, it might result in data leak as data are send to nodes in different network directly (not over zt). However, this is what allegedly happens on other platforms due to high interface metric, so this makes this Linux consistent with other platforms (who are in majority and this is what most people want anyway).

The route entries that have a nonzero leading octet (like 10.42.0.0/16, 242.0.0.0/8) are successfully being propagated to the client (Linux Debian and Ubuntu), in that the routing table quickly shows those very entries just like they are provided in the ZeroTier UI.

However, any entry that begins with a leading zero octet (such as 0.0.0.0/3, 0.1.2.0/24, 0.1.0.0/16) is not being propagated in any way to the client.

A use case I have is to let a client connect to two ZeroTier networks, each of which provide outbound internet connectivity. When the \"primary\" one is connected (as I'd like it to be at all times), this shows in the routing table as 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1. But when the \"secondary\" network is also enabled and connected, then routing entries like 0.0.0.0/2, 64.0.0.0/2, 128.0.0.0/2, and 192.0.0.0/2 are meant to override the first one in the routing table. This leaves the primary one as always valid and an acceptable fallback. But the secondary one carries the actual traffic when it is enabled.

It seems that what's in the way of this working is some kind of automated filtering on route entries that begin with a zero octet.", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/804/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0 } }, { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/800", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/800/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/800/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/800/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/800", "id": 336340613, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzMzYzNDA2MTM=", "number": 800, "title": "iOS can't join over cellular network", "user": { "login": "peewee5", "id": 36014547, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDE0NTQ3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/36014547?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/peewee5", "html_url": "https://github.com/peewee5", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peewee5/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peewee5/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peewee5/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peewee5/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peewee5/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peewee5/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peewee5/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peewee5/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peewee5/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false }, "labels": [ { "id": 130619560, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMzA2MTk1NjA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/labels/cantreproduce", "name": "cantreproduce", "color": "000000", "default": false } ], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [ ], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2018-06-27T18:31:43Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-20T23:02:43Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "body": "I'm running into an issue where I can't connect to any other hosts on my network from my phone, (iPhone X), when I am on the cellular network (T-Mobile).

Im hoping this issnt quite a NOOB question. But hi ho! hope someone can help me :-)

I have 3 edgemax Pro's that i want to do OSPF.

I have created on each router 1 interface for OSPF

R1 = 10.78.33.1
R2 = 10.78.33.2
R3= 10.78.33.3

These interfaces speak to one another using ZeroTier. 
All im doing to get this going is in the GUI (keeping it simple for now) adding the 10.78.33.0/24 (OSPF interfaces) and then the networks i want each router to announce and for the others to learn.

When i set this up for 2 Routers it works fine. When i add in the next router the existing connection breaks. And i think i am doing something wrong! Not sure if its OSPF or ZeroT? 

R1= 10.78.33.0/24, 10.49.97.0/24
R2= 10.78.33.0/24, 10.0.0.0/24
R3= 10.78.33.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24

so currently R3 and R2 are working perfectly. When i add in R! to the mix, R3 & and R2 break entirely. Cannot communicate at all.

Looking at documentation on UBNT i cant see anyone doing something similar to how i've set it up. Most people by the sounds of it. do this: 

get R1 to R2 and R2 to R3 so R1 can talk to R3 via R2. But ultimately i dont want to do that.

I want the 3 routers to talk in the ZeroTier chat room swapping links.

Please someone tell me this is possible? 

I have added 10.78.33.0/24 as a \"LAN\" under managed routes. 

each site has a linux box bridging the ZT* interface to a virtual interface. This is then in a VLAN to the edgemax router. So that each router can talk in the chat room. 

If dont implement OSPF all 3 routers speak fine. 

Hope someone can help.

Since #651 it is possible to enter custom DNS when *adding* a network. However I don't see an option to *edit* the list of DNS servers once the network has been added. I have to delete and re-add the network to enter new DNS. Would it be possible to give the users the option to edit such settings for an existing network?", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/790/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0 } } ]
